* OpenStack SDK Light

The goal of this project is to have Rest API client for OpenStack with
as least additional code overhead as possible.

Basically, it is os-client-config [1] + bravado swagger client [2],
almost the same as openstacksdk [3], but with yaml schema definition
instead of code.

Example:

1. git clone <openstack sdk light>
2. update clouds.yaml
3. explore/update schemas
4. run code

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import os_sdk_light as osl


compute_client = osl.get_client(
    cloud='devstack',
    service='compute',
    schema=osl.schema('compute.yaml'))

flavors = compute_client.flavors.list_flavors()['flavors']
#+END_SRC
